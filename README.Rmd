The goal of `polite` is to promote responsible web etiquette. 

> __"bow and scrape" (verb):__

> 1) To make a deep bow with the right leg drawn back (thus scraping the floor), left hand pressed across the abdomen, right arm held aside.

The package's two main functions `bow` and `scrape` define and realize a web harvesting session. `bow` is used to introduce the client to the host and ask for permission to scrape (by inquiring against the host's `robots.txt` file), while `scrape` is the main function for retrieving data from the remote server. Once the connection is established, there's no need to `bow` again. Rather, in order to adjust a scraping URL the user can simply `nod` to the new path, which updates the session's URL, making sure that the new location can be negotiated against `robots.txt`.

The three pillars of a `polite session` are **seeking permission, taking slowly and never asking twice**.

The package builds on awesome toolkits for defining and managing http sessions (`httr` and `rvest`), declaring the user agent string and investigating site policies (`robotstxt`), and utilizing rate-limiting and response caching (`ratelimitr` and `memoise`).

## Installation

You can install `polite` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("polite")
```

Development version of the package can be installed from [Github](https://www.github.com/dmi3kno/polite) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dmi3kno/polite")
```


## Basic Example


This is a basic example which shows how to retrieve the list of semi-soft cheeses from www.cheese.com. Here, we authenticate a session and then scrape the page with specified parameters. Behind the scenes `polite` retrieves `robots.txt`, checks the URL and user agent string against it, caches the call to `robots.txt` and to the web page and enforces rate limiting.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(polite)
library(rvest)

session <- bow("https://www.cheese.com/by_type", force = TRUE)
result <- scrape(session, query=list(t="semi-soft", per_page=100)) %>%
  html_node("#main-body") %>% 
  html_nodes("h3") %>% 
  html_text()
head(result)
```

## Extended Example

You can build your own functions that incorporate `bow`, `scrape` (and, if required, `nod`). Here we will extend our inquiry into cheeses and will download all cheese names and URLs to their information pages. Let's retrieve the number of pages per letter in the alphabetical list, keeping the number of results per page to 100 to minimize number of web requests.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(polite)
library(rvest)
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)

session <- bow("https://www.cheese.com/alphabetical")

# this is only to illustrate the example.
letters <- letters[1:3] # delete this line to scrape all letters

responses <- map(letters, ~scrape(session, query = list(per_page=100,i=.x)) )
results <- map(responses, ~html_nodes(.x, "#id_page li") %>% 
                           html_text(trim = TRUE) %>% 
                           as.numeric() %>%
                           tail(1) ) %>% 
           map(~pluck(.x, 1, .default=1))
pages_df <- tibble(letter = rep.int(letters, times=unlist(results)),
                   pages = unlist(map(results, ~seq.int(from=1, to=.x))))
pages_df
```

Now that we know how many pages to retrieve from each letter page, let's rotate over letter pages and retrieve cheese names and underlying links to cheese details. We will need to write a helper function. Our session is still valid and we don't need to `nod` again, because we will not be modifying a page URL, only its parameters (note that the field `url` is missing from `scrape` function).

```{r}
get_cheese_page <- function(letter, pages){
 lnks <- scrape(session, query=list(per_page=100,i=letter,page=pages)) %>% 
    html_nodes("h3 a")
tibble(name=lnks %>% html_text(),
       link=lnks %>% html_attr("href"))
}

df <- pages_df %>% pmap_df(get_cheese_page)
df
```

## Another example

Bob Rudis is one the vocal proponents of an online etiquette in the R community. If you have never seen his robots.txt file, you should definitely [check it out](https://rud.is/robots.txt)! Lets look at his [blog](https://rud.is/b/). We don't know how many pages will the gallery return, so we keep going until there’s no more “Older posts” button. Note that I first `bow` to the host and then simply `nod` to the current scraping page inside the `while` loop.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(polite)
    library(rvest)
    
    hrbrmstr_posts <- data.frame()
    url <- "https://rud.is/b/"
    session <- bow(url)
    
    while(!is.na(url)){
      # make it verbose
      message("Scraping ", url)
      # nod and scrape
      current_page <- nod(session, url) %>% 
        scrape(verbose=TRUE)
      # extract post titles
      hrbrmstr_posts <- current_page %>% 
        html_nodes(".entry-title a") %>% 
        polite::html_attrs_dfr() %>% 
        rbind(hrbrmstr_posts)
      # see if there's "Older posts" button
      url <- current_page %>% 
        html_node(".nav-previous a") %>% 
        html_attr("href")
    } # end while loop
    
    tibble::as_tibble(hrbrmstr_posts)
    #> # A tibble: 578 x3
```

We organize the data into the tidy format and append it to our empty data frame. At the end we will discover that Bob has written over 570 blog articles, which I very much recommend anyone to check out.

## Polite for package developers

If you are developing a package which accesses the web, `polite` can be used either as a *template*, or as a *backend* for your polite web session.

### Polite template

Just before its ascension to CRAN, the package acquired new functionality for helping package developers get started on creating polite web tools for the users. Any modern package developer is probably familiar with excellent [`usethis` package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis) by Rstudio team. `usethis` is a collection of scripts for automating package development workflow. Many `usethis` functions automating repetitive tasks start with prefix `use_` indicating that what followed will be adopted and "used" by the package user developes. For details about `use_` family of functions, see [package documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html). 

`{polite}` has one usethis-like function called `polite::use_manners()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
polite::use_manners()
```

When called within the analysis (or package) directory, it creates a new file called `R/polite-scrape.R` (creating `R` directory if necessary) and populates it with template functions for creating polite web-scraping session. The functions provided by `polite::use_manners()` are drop-in replacements for two of the most popular tools in web-accessing R ecosystem: `read_html()` and `download.file()`. The only difference is that these functions have `polite_` prefix. In all other respects they should have look and feel of the original, i.e. in most cases you should be able to simply replace calls to `read_html()` with `polite_read_html()` and `download.file` with `polite_download_file()` and your code should work (provided you scrape from a `url`, which it the first required argument in both functions).

### Polite backend

Recent addition to polite package is a [`purrr`-like](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-adverbs) adverb `politely()` which can make any web-accessing function "polite" by wrapping it with a code which delivers on four pillars of polite session: 

> **Introduce Yourself, Seek Permission, Take Slowly and Never Ask Twice**.

Adverbs can be useful, when a user (package developer) wants to "delegate" polite session handling to external package, without modifying the existing code. The only thing user needs to do is wrap existing verb with `politely()` and use the new function instead of the original.

Let's say you wanted to use `httr::GET` for accessing certain API, such as `musicbrainz` and extract certain data from a deeply nested list, returned by the server. Your originally developed code looks like this:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(httr)
library(xml2)
library(purrr)

beatles_res <- GET("https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/", 
                   query=list(query="Beatles", limit=10),
                   httr::accept("application/json")) 
if(!is.null(beatles_res)) beatles_lst <- httr::content(beatles_res, type = "application/json")

str(beatles_lst, max.level = 2)
```

This code does not comply with `polite` principles. It does not provide human-readable user-agent string, it does not consult `robots.txt` about permissions. It is possible to run this code in the loop and (accidentally) overwhelm the server with requests.  It does not cache the results, so if this code is re-run again, data will be re-queried.

You could write your own infastructure for handling useragent, robots.txt, rate limiting and memoisation, or you could simply use an adverb `politely()` which does all of these things for you.

### Querying colormind.io with polite backend

Here's an example from using colormind.io API. We will need a couple of service functions to convert colors between HEX and RGB and to prepare a json [required by the service](http://colormind.io/api-access/).

```{r}
rgba2hex <- function(r,g,b,a) {grDevices::rgb(r, g, b, a, maxColorValue = 255)}

hex2rgba <- function(x, alpha=TRUE){t(grDevices::col2rgb(x, alpha = alpha))}

prepare_colormind_query <- function(x, model){
  lst <- list(model=model)

  if(!is.null(x)){
    x <- utils::head(c(x, rep(NA_character_, times=4)), 5) # pad it with NAs
    x_mat <- hex2rgba(x)
    x_lst <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(x_mat)), function(i) if(x_mat[i,4]==0) "N" else x_mat[i,1:3])
    lst <- c(list(input=x_lst), lst)
  }
  jsonlite::toJSON(lst, auto_unbox = TRUE)
}
```

Now all we have to do is to "wrap" existing function in the `politely` adverb. Then call the new function insted of original. You dont need to change anything other than a function name.

```{r}
polite_GET <- politely(httr::GET, verbose=TRUE) 

#res <- httr::GET("http://colormind.io/list") # was
res <- polite_GET("http://colormind.io/list") # now
jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(res, as = "text"))$result
```

The backend functionality of `polite` can be used for *any* function as long as it has `url` argument (or the first argument is a url). Here's an example of polite POST created with adverb `politely`.

```{r}
polite_POST <- politely(POST, verbose=TRUE) 

clue_colors <-c(NA, "lightseagreen", NA, "coral", NA)

req <- prepare_colormind_query(clue_colors, "default")

#res <- httr::POST(url='http://colormind.io/api/', body = req) #was
res <- polite_POST(url='http://colormind.io/api/', body = req) #now
res_json <- httr::content(res, as = "text")
res_mcol <- jsonlite::fromJSON(res_json)$result
colrs <- rgba2hex(res_mcol)
scales::show_col(colrs, ncol = 5)
```

### Querying musicbrainz API with polite backend

[Musicbrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2) allows querying data on artists, releases, labels and all things music. API endpoint, unfortunately, is Disallowed in `robots.txt`, but it is completely legal to access for small size requests. Mass querying is easier using a datadump, with musicbrainz published periodically. We can create polite GET and turn off `robots.txt` validation. 

```{r}
library(polite)
polite_GET_nrt <- politely(GET, verbose=TRUE, robots = FALSE) # turn off robotstxt checking

beatles_lst <- polite_GET_nrt("https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/", 
                   query=list(query="Beatles", limit=10),
                   httr::accept("application/json")) %>% 
  httr::content(type = "application/json")
str(beatles_lst, max.level = 2)
```

Lets parse the response

```{r}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
beatles_lst %>%   
  extract2("artists") %>% 
  {tibble::tibble(id=map_chr(.,"id", .default=NA_character_),
                  match_pct=map_int(.,"score", .default=NA_character_),
                  type=map_chr(.,"type", .default=NA_character_),
                  name=map_chr(., "name", .default=NA_character_),
                  country=map_chr(., "country", .default=NA_character_),
                  lifespan_begin=map_chr(., c("life-span", "begin"),.default=NA_character_),
                  lifespan_end=map_chr(., c("life-span", "end"),.default=NA_character_)
                  )
    } %>% knitr::kable(col.names = c(id="Musicbrainz ID", match_pct="Match, %", 
                                     type="Type", name="Name of artist",
                                     country="Country", lifespan_begin="Career begun",
                                     lifespan_end="Career ended")) 
```
