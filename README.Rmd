The goal of `polite` is to promote responsible web etiquette. 

> __"bow and scrape" (verb):__ 
>
> 1) To make a deep bow with the right leg drawn back (thus scraping the floor), left hand pressed across the abdomen, right arm held aside.
>
> 2) _(idiomatic, by extension)_ To behave in a servile, obsequious, or excessively polite manner. [1]

The package's two main functions `bow` and `scrape` define and realize a web harvesting session. `bow` is used to introduce the client to the host and ask for permission to scrape (by inquiring against the host's `robots.txt` file), while `scrape` is the main function for retrieving data from the remote server. Once the connection is established, there's no need to `bow` again. Rather, in order to adjust a scraping URL the user can simply `nod` to the new path, which updates the session's URL, making sure that the new location can be negotiated against `robots.txt`.

The three pillars of a `polite session` are **seeking permission, taking slowly and never asking twice**.

The package builds on awesome toolkits for defining and managing http sessions (`httr` and `rvest`), declaring the user agent string and investigating site policies (`robotstxt`), and utilizing rate-limiting and response caching (`ratelimitr` amd `memoise`).

## Installation

You can install the  development version of `polite` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmi3kno/polite")
```

## Basic Example


This is a basic example which shows how to retrive the list of semi-soft cheeses from www.cheese.com. Here, we authenticate a session and then scrape the page with specified parameters. Behind the scenes `polite` retrieves `robots.txt`, checks the URL and user agent string against it, caches the call to `robots.txt` and to the web page and enforces rate limiting.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(polite)
library(rvest)

session <- bow("https://www.cheese.com/by_type", force = TRUE)
result <- scrape(session, query=list(t="semi-soft",per_page=100)) %>%
  html_node("#main-body") %>% 
  html_nodes("h3") %>% 
  html_text()
head(result)
```

## Extended Example

You can build your own functions that incorporate `bow`, `scrape` (and, if required, `nod`). Here we will extend our inquiry into cheeses and will download all cheese names and URLs to their information pages. Let's retrieve the number of pages per letter in the alphabetical list, keeping the number of results per page to 100 to minimize number of web requests.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(polite)
library(rvest)
library(purrr)

session <- bow("https://www.cheese.com/alphabetical")

# this is only to illustrate the example.
letters <- letters[1:3] # delete this line to scrape all letters

responses <- map(letters, ~scrape(session, query = list(per_page=100,i=.x)) )
results <- map(responses, ~html_nodes(.x, "#id_page li") %>% 
                           html_text(trim = TRUE) %>% 
                           as.numeric() %>%
                           tail(1) ) %>% 
           map(~pluck(.x, 1, .default=1))
pages_df <- data.frame(letter = rep.int(letters, times=unlist(results)),
                       pages = unlist(map(results, ~seq.int(from=1, to=.x))), 
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(pages_df, 10)
```

Now that we know how many pages to retrieve from each letter page, let's rotate over letter pages and retrieve cheese names and underlying links to cheese details. We will need to write a helper function. Our session is still valid and we don't need to `nod` again, because we will not be modifying a page URL, only its parameters (note that the field `url` is missing from `scrape` function).

```{r}
get_cheese_page <- function(letter, pages){
 lnks <- scrape(session, query=list(per_page=100,i=letter,page=pages)) %>% 
    html_nodes("h3 a")
 data.frame(name=lnks %>% html_text(),
           link=lnks %>% html_attr("href"),
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}

df <- pages_df %>% pmap_df(get_cheese_page)
head(df, 10)
```
