#&gt; 44                                                                                                                                                                                 The observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, graphology, and some types of personality tests.[51]

People may base their expectations and perceptions of a robot on its appearance (form) and attribute functions which do not necessarily mirror the true functions of the robot.[52]

#&gt; 47          The frequency illusion is that once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed, leading to the belief it has a high frequency of occurrence (a form of selection bias).[53] The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon is the illusion where something that has recently come to one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards.[54] The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon is sometimes conflated with frequency illusion and the recency illusion.[55] It was named after an incidence of frequency illusion in which the Baader–Meinhof Group was mentioned.[56]

The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the law of large numbers. For example, "I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads."[58]

For example, the assumption that women are less suited to jobs requiring high intellectual ability[61]. Or the assumption that people or animals are male in the absence of any indicators of gender.[62]

Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.

#&gt; 56  Discounting is the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs. Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time – people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning.[68] Also known as current moment bias, present-bias, and related to Dynamic inconsistency. A good example of this: a study showed that when making food choices for the coming week, 74% of participants chose fruit, whereas when the food choice was for the current day, 70% chose chocolate.

Also known as bikeshedding, this bias explains why an organization may avoid specialized or complex subjects, such as the design of a nuclear reactor, and instead focus on something easy to grasp or rewarding to the average participant, such as the design of an adjacent bike shed.[105]

#&gt; 1  The tendency for explanations of other individuals' behaviors to overemphasize the influence of their personality and underemphasize the influence of their situation (see also Fundamental attribution error), and for explanations of one's own behaviors to do the opposite (that is, to overemphasize the influence of our situation and underemphasize the influence of our own personality).

#&gt; 21                                                                                                                                                      The belief that we see reality as it really is – objectively and without bias; that the facts are plain for all to see; that rational people will agree with us; and that those who don't are either uninformed, lazy, irrational, or biased.
#&gt; 22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Individuals see members of their own group as being relatively more varied than members of other groups.[115]
#&gt; 23                                                                                                                                                                Refers to the tendency to attribute cause of an undesirable outcome or wrongdoing by an individual to a moral deficiency or lack of self control rather than taking into account the impact of broader societal determinants .[116]
#&gt; 24                                                                                                                                                           The tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests (see also group-serving bias).[117]
#&gt; 25                                                                                                         Known as the tendency for group members to spend more time and energy discussing information that all members are already familiar with (i.e., shared information), and less time and energy discussing information that only some members are aware of (i.e., unshared information).[118]
#&gt; 26                                                                                                                                  The tendency to defend and bolster the status quo. Existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred, and alternatives disparaged, sometimes even at the expense of individual and collective self-interest. (See also status quo bias.)
#&gt; 27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior, and mood while viewing others as much more predictable.
#&gt; 28                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Similar to the fundamental attribution error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group.

Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory.[126]

#&gt; 16 A smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well. For example, consider a list of 30 items ("L30") and a list of 100 items ("L100"). An individual may remember 15 items from L30, or 50%, whereas the individual may remember 40 items from L100, or 40%. Although the percent of L30 items remembered (50%) is greater than the percent of L100 (40%), more L100 items (40) are remembered than L30 items (15).[128][further explanation needed]

#&gt; 38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of "blocking" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other.[123]
#&gt; 39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Overestimating the significance of the present.[146] It is related to chronological snobbery with possibly an appeal to novelty logical fallacy being part of the bias.
#&gt; 40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       That the "gist" of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording.[147] This is because memories are representations, not exact copies.

#&gt; 42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    That uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.
